# Random Message Generator!
Javascript program that randomly generates a message from different arrays of strings.

## Program Description
The program inside of 'script.js' generates a random message from a different sets of arrays created at the beginning of the file. This project was created as part of the [Codecademy Software Engineer](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path) career path. The focus was to use built in and created functions to create a different number of satirical (or sometimes negative) inspirational messages to be written to the console log. Currently there are **49** seperate possibilities that can be printed to the console.

## Development Plans
The plan for this program is to eventually attach this javascript program to an html page with CSS styling to fully cemet lessons from the **Codecademy Program**. Updates for features added and progessions with this project will be added to the Update section at the bottom of this file.
